# webscrappingClassical
One of my favorite radios is yourClassical.org and they offer a free space where I am able to download a song daily.
I cannot handle to download the file everyday, so decided to automate the task as much as I can to enjoy different songs.

There are many things to improve in my script, such as get the name of the song and compositor as filename, not download the song if already exists, catch a song inmmediately if there is new uploads and so on. I will do it gradually, just for fun :)
